# 📅 Daily Activity Tracker

This project is a **full-stack web application** for tracking and visualizing daily activities.  
Users can log what they did during the day, how long it took, and add comments. Activities are categorized with a **hierarchical tagging system**, and entries are displayed visually in a timeline-like view.

It was developed as a **learning project** to practice **React, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Python (data analytics), and Docker**.

## 📂 Project Features

- **Event Entries**:  
  Each entry stores the type of activity, its duration, and optional comments.  

- **Tagging System**:  
  Tags are hierarchical (e.g., `Work → Study` or `Work → Home chores`).  
  Child tags can have their own child tags, allowing flexible categorization.  

- **Timeline Visualization**:  
  Activities are displayed in a **month view** where each day is a row.  
  Entries appear as colored bars depending on their tag.  
  Supports **multitasking** (parallel activities displayed on the same timeline).  

- **Authentication**:  
  Includes a login system so users can track their activities privately.  

- **Data Analytics (Python)**:  
  A separate module for experimenting with Python and analyzing logged data.
